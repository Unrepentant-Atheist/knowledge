Meat is nice but definitely unsustainable. Instead of buying poopy products at
the store, it's better to make your own delish ingredient substitutes for your
favorite dishes that won't be available in a few years.

## Vacon (vegan bacon)
### ingredients
- rice paper, cut into approx. 2.5 cm wide strips with a pair of kitchen

- For the marinade:
- 2 tbsp teriyaki sauce (use soy sauce alternatively)
- 2 tbsp sweet chilli sauce
- 1 tbsp liquid smoke
- 2 teaspoons smoked paprika
- dash grinded pepper
- 1/2 glass of water
- 4 tablespoons nutritional yeast

- salt to taste
- dash of olive oil

### preparation
- Mix all the marinade ingredients in a bowl and leave aside.
- fill a small bowl with some warm water and start soaking a double layer of
  strips for a few seconds into it. You will notice it will go soggy very soon,
  Lift it and squeeze the extra water between your fingers.
- Place the strips in the marinade and prepare a non stick frying pan on a
  medium low heat with some oilve oil in it.
- Fry the strips by working them with two forks or tongs to turn them on the
  other side and stretch them a little to achieve an irregular shape.
- Once happy with the cooking, place on some kitchen towel to absorb the extra
  fat.
